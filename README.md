# An-improve-on-ResNet-Introduces-dynamic-connections
Studying ResNet sparked an idea: instead of fixed shortcut connections why not let them dynamically "grow"? I introduced learnable weights per layer, enabling the network to 'grow' the connection strength by itself. Though my advisor considered it impractical, as my first original concept, I’ve uploaded it to GitHub to mark the milestone.
